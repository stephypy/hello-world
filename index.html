		<p>Hi, my name is Stephanie. I am computer science student interested in web development and data analytics. I promote diversity and inclusion in STEM fields by being an active member of my college's Women In Computer Science (ACM-Wics) club and by being a role model as an undergraduate assistant for introduction to computer science students. I continue to strive for excellence by maintaining a major GPA of 4.0 and by acquring experience through internships and projects. I plan to graduate on December 2021 from the University of Texas at El Paso with a bachelor of science in computer science and a concentration on data analytics. Thank you for visiting my page and feel free to read on more on my journey as a young programmer. </p>
