    <h1>Internships.</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      The word <i>internship</i> does not necessarily exist in my native
      language (spanish), so at first I was confused why people at my school
      kept mentioning it. I had no idea it was possible to temporarily work at a tech
      company as a student, so with the advice and encouragement of several
      upperclassmen, I started applying to internships every year. Who would
      have known? Now I can share with you what I learned in my internships.
      Enjoy!

  <h4>About the EP Internship</h4>

  <p>
    The EP (Engineering Practicum) Internship was the freshman/sophomore summer
    internship program at Google; Google later changed the name to STEP
    (Student Training in Engineering Program). In this internship, students were
    paired with another fellow intern to work on a project together with the
    guidance of a host and a co-host for 12 weeks. In addition to working on a
    project, Google interns were encouraged to get a mentor, attend career-growth
    workshops, and interact with Google engineers outside of their team.

  <h4>Application Process</h4>

  <p>
    Just a quick important note! The application process for (ST)EP interns and
    SWE interns is different; I will be covering what was my application process
    to apply to Google as a freshman.
  </p>

  <p>
    I first applied to Google in fall 2018 through their website. Since I was
    a freshman at a time, the application for the EP internship required some
    short response essays with prompts about my motivation behind studying
    computer science, my extracurricular activities, etcetera. The application
    also required the standard personal information and resume, but as a freshman,
    the essays were going to be the most important factor for determining the
    opportunity to get an interview
  </p>

  <p>
    After applying, I had to wait to either get an interview to move to the next
    phase, or to get rejected. I applied to the EP internship around September/October
    and I was invited for an interview in January. Generally, the technical
    interviews are held via phone call, but I was told I could do my interview
    in person at my school.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interview consisted of two parts: a code reading and a whiteboard problem.
    During the code reading section of the interview, my interviewer gave me some
    coding to read and identify any errors or any changes that could improve the
    code. At the time I had not yet taken any data structures class, so ocassionally
    I had to ask my interviewer to explain the data structures I couldn't
    recognize. Overall, it was a learning experience for me because I walked out
    of the room having learned a new data structure. I was nervous at first, but
    the more I talked to my interviewer, the more I enjoyed the whole process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Afterwards, I had my whiteboard technical interview. This interview was quite
    intimidating because my interviewer looked serious, but he was simply allowing
    me to explain my thought process. He gave me a problem and I started talking
    about the first solutions that came to mind. I asked for examples so I could
    identify any edge cases, and I did some drawings on the whiteboard to help me
    find a solution. My first implementation was not the most effective one and
    I acknowledged this observation to my interviewer. I had some time left, so
    I did some changes to my code to improve my solution. Sincerely, I walked
    out of that interview feeling defeated, but that feeling was a result of this
    being my first official whiteboard interview.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several months later, I received a call back. Google seemed to like my
    performance and I was asked to fill out a form to either accept or reject
    the offer. After I accepted the offer, I entered the project matching phase.
    I was given a form to show my skills and interests and my recruiter set up
    interviews with potential hosts. I was matched with a team in Sunnyvale,
    California and I was going to meet my fellow intern during orientation.
  </p>

  <h4>My project</h4>
  <p>
    This internship was my first time doing frontend development. My project
    consisted on developing an internal tool (externally referred as Web Test
    Results Comparison) to help Google web developers troubleshoot their test
    results. This tool was developed using Angular with Typescript. It was
    estimated to improve the testing workflow of approximately 5k users. The
    project was significant because when testing, web developers have to take
    into account how their work might run in different platforms, browsers,
    and versions.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the time, the Web Test Results Comparison only allowed showing one test
    run at a time which could be problematic since some tests can pass/fail on
    some configurations or runs. The goal for the summer was to implement a
    diffing algorithm to allow users to compare two test runs and improve the
    debugging process.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main contributions related to the user inteface, namely creating a confirmation
    dialog for saving or canceling versions, creating the styling of buttons and
    icons, and highlighting differences found in two test log entries. Additional
    key contributions were adding routing to the diff results page, implementing a
    filter for user and test run status (such as failed, passed, etc), and I
    created test cases for the diffing algorithm which my co-worker implemented.
  </p>

  <h4>My thoughts</h4>

  <p>
    Being an intern for Google was both an intimidating and exciting experience,
    and although at times I felt like I didn't belong there (due to the imposter
    syndrome), I made some great friendships with other interns and I learned more
    about the world of web development thanks to the encouragement of my hosts.
    I was merely an intern who had just finished her first year in college and
    thus didn't have much experience, but after that summer I felt inspired to
    look more into what frontend development had to offer.
